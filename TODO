Short term:
    optimize c++ part
    test structure generation from dihedrals
    test on different types of structure (make sure NMR ones and ribosome work)
    test on robustness, error output, maybe filtering
    compare to two competitors at least
    display adjecency matrix
    check runtime from q dependency
    check with initialized coords and small perturbations

Long term:
    add fixed coordinate subsets / initialization
