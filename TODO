Short term:
    implement central Distructure class to interface between Bio Structure and graph representation
    put in new default topology database with amino acids, nucleic acids and better alphabet handling
    optimize c++ part
    test on different types of structure (make sure NMR ones and ribosome work)
    test on robustness, error output, maybe filtering
    compare to DYANA and CONCOORD at least

Long term:
    add fixed coordinate subsets / initialization
